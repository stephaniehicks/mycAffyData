=========

This package contains the raw data from the paper by 
  Loven et al. (2012). Revisiting Global Gene Expression Analysis. 
  Cell 151:476-482. The experiement was to perform a genome-wide 
  analysis on P493-6 cells expressing low or high levels of c-Myc and 
  investigate the use of quantile normalization with this data. The 
  data can be found online at GEO Accession ID GSE40784. 

There are four samples total. Two technical duplicates each for 
  the high and low c-myc samples.
